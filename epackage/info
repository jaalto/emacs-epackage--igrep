Description: An improved interface to `grep` and `find`
 Provides commands igrep, igrep-find. Commands provide defaults for
 the REGEX and FILES arguments based on the current word and the
 visited file name. When run interactively from Dired mode, the
 various `igrep' commands provide defaults for the REGEX and FILES
 arguments that are based on the visited directory.
